<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We are trying to make easy file explorer with good functionality that you'll be able to use it as your main file explorer application.
Our File Explorer has good looking console UI - with colors and good text design.

Of course there are better file explorers, but at least you can get some inspiration from our code or you might like console applications.



## Installation

Get a version from https://github.com/bexcool/FileExplorer/releases


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can use this application as your default file browser! It is fully functional (We need to add copying directories - for now, you can just create new directory with same name and copy files there) file explorer. It works like your normal file explorer - explore files, create files, read files, run apps and more!
